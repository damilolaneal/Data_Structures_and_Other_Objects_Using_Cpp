# About
A collection of end-of-chapter projects from "Data Structures and Other Objects Using C++" (4th edition) by Michael Main and Walter Savitch.

Besides STL, some examples rely on:

1. Boost 
2. [Rapid CSV](https://github.com/d99kris/rapidcsv)
3. [date](https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date), which will be added to the C++ standard library in C++20
