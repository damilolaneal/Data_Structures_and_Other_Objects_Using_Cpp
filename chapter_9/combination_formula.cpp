 *
 * The formula for computing the number of
ways of choosing r different things from a
set of n things is the following:
n !
C ( n , r ) = ----------------------
r ! ( n – r ) !
In this formula, the factorial function is represented
by an exclamation point (!), and defined as the product:
n ! = n × ( n – 1 ) × ( n – 2 ) × ... × 1
Discover a recursive version of the C(n, r) formula
and write a recursive C++ function that computes
the value of the formula. Embed the function in a
program and test it.
