 Problem statement

 Tic-Tac-Twice is a game invented by Pat
Baggett and Andrzej Ehrenfeucht. It is
distributed by the Aristoplay company. The
rules are simple, starting with two 4x4 boards that
each have a pattern of 16 letters (or other objects). If
you use the letters A through P, then the two boards
have these patterns:
Board 1
Board 2
8
A B C D B K M H
E F G H P E C J
I J K L G N L A
M N O P I D F O
The two players (human and computer) take alter-
nate turns. During your turn, you can place a checker
of your color on an empty spot on Board 1. At the
same time, you put a checker of your color on the
square in Block 2 with the same letter. For example,
if you put your checker in the bottom-left corner of
Board 1 (letter M), then you would simultaneously
put one of your checkers on the third spot of the top
row of Board 2 (also letter M).
You win the game by having four of your circles
in a row (horizontally, diagonally, or vertically) on
either of the boards. Note that you donâ€™t need four in
a row on both boards, just on one of them.
Implement a class that lets a user play Tic-
Tac-Twice against the computer. Use the game class
from Section 14.3 as your base class.
