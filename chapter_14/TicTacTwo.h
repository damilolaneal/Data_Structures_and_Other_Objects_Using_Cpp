     Problem statement

     Tic-Tac-Twice is a game invented by Pat
    Baggett and Andrzej Ehrenfeucht. It is
    distributed by the Aristoplay company. The
    rules are simple, starting with two 4x4 boards that
    each have a pattern of 16 letters (or other objects). If
    you use the letters A through P, then the two boards
    have these patterns:
    Board 1
    Board 2
    8
    A B C D B K M H
    E F G H P E C J
    I J K L G N L A
    M N O P I D F O
    The two players (human and computer) take alter-
    nate turns. During your turn, you can place a checker
    of your color on an empty spot on Board 1. At the
    same time, you put a checker of your color on the
    square in Block 2 with the same letter. For example,
    if you put your checker in the bottom-left corner of
    Board 1 (letter M), then you would simultaneously
    put one of your checkers on the third spot of the top
    row of Board 2 (also letter M).
    You win the game by having four of your circles
    in a row (horizontally, diagonally, or vertically) on
    either of the boards. Note that you donâ€™t need four in
    a row on both boards, just on one of them.
    Implement a class that lets a user play Tic-
    Tac-Twice against the computer. Use the game class
    from Section 14.3 as your base class.
